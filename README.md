<body><!-- Academic -->

  🎓 I am graduated in Systems Analysis and Development, and currently studying Software Engineering at École 42 São Paulo. <br />

  📜 I have the **Scrum Foundation Professional Certificate** certification

  I like project architecture, writing clean code, applying good practices, technology, hot chocolate 🥤(don't like coffee ☕️ hahaha) and applying my knowledge to solve problems, create solutions and impact lives because this is what i believe. So, that's it. ☺
